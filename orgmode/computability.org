* Model of Computation
  In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a model of
  computation is the definition of set of allowable operations used in
  computation and their respective costs. It is used for measuring the
  complexity of an algorithm in execution time and memory space. In the field of
  runtime analysis of algorithm, it is common to specify a computational model
  in terms of prmitive operations allowed which have unit costs.
* Lambda Calculus
** Lambda terms
   A valid lambda calculus expression is called *lambda term*.
   A lambda term is 
   1. a variable, x, is itself a lambda term.
   2. if t is lambda term and x is variable then (Î»x.t) is a lambda term (called
      a lambda abstraction)
   3. it t and s are lambda terms, then (ts) is a lambda term (called
      application)
   
   Nothing else is a lambda term.
