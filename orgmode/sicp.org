* Preface to First Addition
  Computer Language is not just a way of getting computer to perform operations
  but rather that it is novel formal medium for expressing ideas about
  methodology. Thus,  programs must be written for people to read, and only
  incidentally for machines to execute. The material of this book addresses the
  the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software
  systems.
  Computer Science is not a science and its significance has little to do with
  computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in
  the way we express what we think.
* Building Abstraction with procedures
  We are about to study the idea of /computational processes/. Computational
  processes are abstract being that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes
  manipulate other abstract things called /data/. The evolution of process is
  directed by a pattern of rules called a /program/. 

  Programs use to conjure processes are composed from symbolic expressions in
  arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our
  processes to perform.

  *Lisp was invented in late 1960's as a formalism for reasoning about the use
   of certain kind of logical expressions called recursion equations as a model
   for computation.*

   A Lisp interpreter is a machine that carries out the process described in
   Lisp Language. The most signficant feature of LISP is its description of
   processes called procedures can themselves be manipuated as LISP data. The
   importance of this is that there are powerful progarm design techinques which
   rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between passive and
   active processes. A Lisp program consist of large number of relatively simple
   procedures. The interpreter maintains memory which consist of name-object
   pair. This memory is called the environment (more precisely /global
   environment/). An /environment/ is the /context/ in which /expressions/ are
   evaluated.
   *A /combination/ is an expression formed by list of expressions delimited*
   *within paranthesis which denotes procedure application.*
   To evaluate a combination
   1. Evaluate the sub expression of the combination.
   2. Apply the procedure that is the value of leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the
      arguments that are the value of other subexpressions (the operands).
   The notion of environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes
   place will play an important role in our understanding of program execution.


   The interpreter runs in read-eval-print loop.

   
   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
     (+ 2 3 (* 2 3))
   #+END_SRC

   Above snippet also shows how scheme provides a way to consturct complex
   expressions from simpler ones by nesting combinations.

   A /special form/ is an exception to general evaluation rule.

   #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
     (define x 24)
     (define (sqrt x) (* x x))
   #+END_SRC
   
   Above snippet shows ~define~ one of several means of abstractions provided by
   scheme which allow us to refer to complex expressions by means of variable.

   The general form of procedure defintion is

   ~(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)~

   The distinction between procedure and function is the difference between
   imperative and declarative knowledge. In mathematics we usually deal with
   decraltive despcriptions but computer science on the other hand requires
   imperative knowledge i.e. how to compute things.

   Newton's Approximation Procedure for finding square roots says whenever we
   have a guess y of the square root of number x, we can better that guess by
   taking an average y with x/y.
** Recursion
   Lets look at the procedure of factorial in following ways
   
   #+begin_src scheme
     (define (factorial n)
       (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1))
           1
           (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
   #+end_src 

   Above snippet is an example of linearly recursive process defined by a
   recursive procedure. 

   On the othe hand the snippet below is an example of linearly iterative
   process described by recursive procedure.

   #+begin_src scheme
     (define (factorial-mod n)
       (define (fact-iter result count)
         (if (> count n)
             result
             (fact-iter (* result count)
                        (+ count 1)))))
   #+end_src 

   The fact that both procedures are recursive is due to fact that in both cases
   the function refers to itself. But the way they evolve are compeltely
   different.

   One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be
   confusing is that most implemenation of common languages are designed in such
   a way that the interpretation of any recursive procedure consumes an amount
   of memory that grows with the number of calls, even when the process
   descirbed is, in principle iterative As a consequence these languages resort
   to special purpose looping construct such as ~for~, ~while~, ~until~ to
   implement iterative procedures. But Scheme will execute an iterative
   process in constant space even if the iterative process is described by the
   recursive procedure. An implementation with this property is called
   *tail-recursive*. IEEE standard of Scheme requires that its implementation be
   tail recursive.
